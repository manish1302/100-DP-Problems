# 100-DP-Problems
I'm going to solve 100 DP problems. !!! ✊🏻✊🏻🏆🏆

## Day1:
- The day 1 went smooth all problems were seemingly easy. All the problems I did were of the same type (0/1 Knapsack). I find it difficult to understand some recursion, so  now I will learn recursion once again.
## Days2: 
- I got sick and I could only do few problems but still I'm not discouraged. I will complete this challenge.
